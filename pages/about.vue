            Mark & Lukas are a Slovakian-based brothers duo with the same
            passion and love for electronic music, especially in the genres of
            trance, deep house, and their favorite summer genre melodic
            progressive house. They started producing their music in 2014. They
            released their first original track on the Fuzzy recordings label in
            2014. Since then they have continued to develop their sound.

            After some time their effort started to pay off and they started to
            have support from world DJs such as Giuseppe Ottaviani, Cosmic Gate,
            Markus Schulz, Paul van Dyk, Aly & Fila, Ruben de Ronde, Roger Shah,
            Jaytech, and many more...

            In 2016 they produced the track 'Colours Of Life' which had an
            unexpected success and reached more than 800,000 plays on YouTube.
            There they developed their unique sound that reflected their passion
            for melodic progressive house. Two years later in 2018, they
            released the track 'Life Is About Moments' which became their most
            popular track on YouTube reaching almost 3 million plays.

            Since then they have produced many originals, remixes, and several
            collaborations with other great artists. Tracks that are also worth
            mentioning are 'Our Home', 'Anywhere In The World', 'Fishing In The
            Archipelago', 'When Nature Is Awakening' and one more deep track
            'Dreams, Where I'm Fading'.

            Now you can enjoy their music more than ever. It will certainly not
