          Mark & Lukas are a Slovakian-based brothers duo with the same passion
          and love for electronic music, especially in the genres of trance,
          deep house, and their favorite summer genre melodic progressive house.
          They started producing their music in 2014. They released their first
          original track on the Fuzzy recordings label in 2014. Since then they
          have continued to develop their sound.

          Markus Schulz, Paul van Dyk, Aly & Fila, Ruben de Ronde, Roger Shah,
          Jaytech, and many more...

          In 2016 they produced the track 'Colours Of Life' which had an
          unexpected success and reached more than 800,000 plays on YouTube.
          There they developed their unique sound that reflected their passion
          for melodic progressive house. Two years later in 2018, they released
          the track 'Life Is About Moments' which became their most popular
          track on YouTube reaching almost 3 million plays.

          collaborations with other great artists. Tracks that are also worth
          mentioning are 'Our Home', 'Anywhere In The World', 'Fishing In The
          Archipelago', 'When Nature Is Awakening' and one more deep track
          'Dreams, Where I'm Fading'.
